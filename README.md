# ReplaceEmoji
Replaces various unsupported emoji with similar, supported ones.

## What is it?
It replaces various emoji with ones supported on a lot of platforms.

## Can I have a demo?
[Sure](https://githubcatw.github.io/redemo/index.html).

## Looks cool! How can I use it?
**There is currently no way to use these scripts unless someone manually adds the scripts into a page.**

## But I am capable of writing extensions/apps that can use the scripts!
You can use these scripts, but **do not link to them! This causes errors in most browsers! Instead, manually add the code to your page in a script tag!**

After the extension/app is available, contact me using [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ntor56), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmailNarek) or [email](http://tny.im/hKP), and I'll add it to the list below.

## Is ReplaceEmoji free?
Yes, it is, but you must credit me.

Example:

```
This app uses ReplaceEmoji.
It is available at https://github.com/githubcatw/ReplaceEmoji.

## Emoji X is missing! Emoji Y is replaced incorrectly! There is no replacement for set Z!
